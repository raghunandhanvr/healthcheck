# Data Atmos

**Data Atmos** makes OLTP, OLAP, and AI orchestration easier with a unified control plane that spins up any datastore in a VPC-peered cluster.

**Data Atmos** is your comprehensive data platform designed for modern applications. Platform-agnosticâ€”bring your own, use ours, or migrate yours seamlessly with 24/7 DBA support. CDC streams auto-lake every write for true millisecond OLAP with built-in engines or external connectorsâ€”no pipeline upkeep. AI agents manage database performance tuning, governance, reporting, and cost optimization by learning workload patterns to preempt issues. Modular GPU pods mount zero-copy data so you can train, customize, and deploy AI models end-to-end privately. DataOps orchestration just got simplerâ€”and your costs just got a whole lot smaller.
